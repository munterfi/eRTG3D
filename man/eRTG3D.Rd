\title{eRTG3D: Empirically Informed Random Trajectory Generator in 3-D}
\description{
The empirically informed random trajectory generator in three dimensions (eRTG3D)
is an algorithm to generate realistic random trajectories in a 3-D space
between two given fix points in space, so-called Conditional Empirical Random Walks.
The trajectory generation is based on empirical distribution functions extracted from
observed trajectories (training data) and thus reflects the geometrical movement
characteristics of the mover. A digital elevation model (DEM),
representing the Earth's surface, and a background layer of probabilities
(e.g. food sources, uplift potential, waterbodies, etc.) can be used to
influence the trajectories.
